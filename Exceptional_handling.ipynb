        "1.  What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages\n",
        "    - Compiled languages translate code into machine instructions before execution, while interpreted languages execute code line-by-line using an interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python\n",
        "    - Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that lets you detect and respond to runtime errors gracefully, preventing your program from crashing. You use try, except, else, and finally blocks to manage these errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling\n",
        "    - The finally block in Python's exception handling is designed to guarantee the execution of cleanup or finalization code, no matter what happens in the try or except blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is logging in Python\n",
        "    - Logging in Python is a built-in mechanism to record events, errors, and informational messages during program execution, helping you debug, monitor, and maintain your code effectively\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "    - The __del__ method in Python is a destructor—a special method that gets called when an object is about to be destroyed. Its main purpose is to allow you to define cleanup behavior, such as releasing resources or logging final actions\n",

        "\n",
        "6.  What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python\n",

        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python\n",
        "   - When you open a file using with, Python ensures the file is automatically closed once the block of code is done even if an exception occurs.This prevents resource leaks and keeps your program efficient.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n",

        "      3. Logs capture what happened in your program at specific times\n",
        "      4. Logging supports levels like DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",

        "11. What is memory management in Python\n",
        "    - All Python objects and data structures are stored in a private heap managed by the Python interpreter.\n",
        "      Python has a garbage collector that automatically frees memory occupied by objects no longer in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python\n",
        "    - Proper memory management ensures these objects don’t consume more memory than necessary,Without it applications could slow down or crash due to memory exhaustion.Python uses reference counting and garbage collection to free memory when objects are no longer needed.Memory management reduces risks of errors like dangling pointers or double frees\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling\n",
        "    - try wraps the code that might raise an exception,python executes the code inside try ,if no error occurs the block runs normally ,if an error occurs Python immediately stops executing the try block and looks for a matching except.\n",
        "\n",
        "    \n",
        "      except defines how to handle specific exceptions,if the error type matches, the code inside except runs.prevents the program from crashing and allows graceful recovery.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work\n",
        "    - Python garbage collection system works by combining reference counting  with a cyclic garbage collector that detects and cleans up objects involved in circular references.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "16.  What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling    \n",
        "     - The else block executes only when the try block completes successfully .\n",
        "\n",
        "    \n",
        "17.  What are the common logging levels in Python\n",
        "     - Python’s logging module defines five standard logging levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. These levels indicate the severity of events and help control what gets logged.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python\n",
        "    - os.fork() is a  low-level system call that creates a new child process by duplicating the current process.available on Unix/Linux\n",
        "       \n",
        "       multiprocessing is a high-level Python library that provides an abstraction for creating and managing processes.available on Windows, Linux, macOS\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python\n",
        "     - When you open a file, Python allocate resources like file handles and memory buffers ,closing the file frees these resources, preventing resource leaks,closing the file flushes the buffer, ensuring all data is actually saved to disk.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python\n",
        "    - file.read() Reads the entire file but file.readline() Reads one line at a time from the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "21.  What is the logging module in Python used for\n",
        "     - The logging module in Python is one of the most powerful tools for monitoring and debugging applications.it records events that happen while your program runs.these events can include normal operations, warnings, errors, or critical failures.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling\n",
        "    - The os module in Python is a bridge between your Python code and the underlying operating system. When it comes to file handling, it gives you low-level control over files and directories that goes beyond just reading and writing with open().\n",
        "     \n",
        "\n",
        "   \n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python\n",
        "    - The main challenges in Python’s memory management include memory leaks, fragmentation, overhead from garbage collection, and inefficient use of data structures. These issues arise because Python relies on automatic memory management, which isn’t always optimal for high performance or real time applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python\n",
        "                  \n",
        "    - you can raise an exception manually using the raise keyword. This is useful when you want to signal that something unexpected has happened in your program, even if Python itself hasn’t detected an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "    - Multithreading is important in certain applications because it allows programs to perform multiple tasks concurrently, improving responsiveness and efficiency.\n",
